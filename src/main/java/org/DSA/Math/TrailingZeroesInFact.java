/*
Intuition:
----------
Counting trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number n! does not require directly computing the factorial
(which is huge even for moderate n). The key insight is that a trailing zero is produced by multiplying 2
and 5 (2 Ã— 5 = 10) and every pair of these factors contributes a zero at the end. However, there are always
more 2s than 5s in factorials, so the number of times 5 appears as a factor in all numbers from 1 to n
determines the number of trailing zeroes.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(log5n)

Space complexity:
O(1)
