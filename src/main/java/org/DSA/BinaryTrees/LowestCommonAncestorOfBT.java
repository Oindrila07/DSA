/*
ðŸ”‘ The Approach Used:
---------------------
This is the standard recursive DFS approach to find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) in a Binary Tree (not just BST).

Key observations:

If the current node is null â†’ no ancestor here, return null.

If the current node is p or q â†’ return it up the recursion (possible ancestor).

Otherwise, recursively search in left and right subtrees.

If both left and right calls return non-null, it means:

one target was found in the left subtree,

the other was found in the right subtree.
â†’ Current node is the lowest common ancestor.

If only one side is non-null, it means both p and q are found in that side (or not found at all in the other). â†’ Propagate the non-null value upward.



ðŸ–¼ Example:
-----------
       3
      / \
     5   1
    / \ / \
   6  2 0  8
     / \
    7   4

Find LCA of p=5, q=1.

helper(3) â†’ left returns 5, right returns 1 â†’ both non-null â†’ return 3.

Find LCA of p=5, q=4.

helper(3) â†’ left subtree eventually returns 5 (since itâ€™s ancestor of 4), right returns null.

So the answer is 5.
