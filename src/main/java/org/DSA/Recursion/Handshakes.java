/*
ðŸ”¹ Approach:
------------
=> There are n people (even number) sitting around a circular table.
=> Each person must shake hands with exactly one other person. No two handshakes are allowed to cross.

Recursive thought process:
--------------------------
=> Pick one fixed person (say person 1).
=> Person 1 must shake hands with some other person k (where k is even so that the remaining people are balanced on both sides).
=> Once person 1 shakes with k, the circle is split into two independent smaller groups:
1) People sitting between 1 and k (excluding 1 and k).
2) The rest of the people outside (from k+1 to n).
These two groups must independently form valid handshake arrangements.

Recursive combination:
---------------------
For each valid k, the total number of ways =
(ways to arrange handshakes in left group) Ã— (ways to arrange handshakes in right group).

Add up this product for all possible choices of k.

Base cases:
If there are 0 people â†’ 1 way (empty arrangement).
If there are 2 people â†’ 1 way (they must shake hands).

Final Answer: Apply the above recursion for n.


Example:
for n=8:

Step 1: Fix person 1
Possible partners: 2, 4, 6, 8 (must be even to balance both sides).

Step 2: Apply recurrence
If 1â€“2 shake: left group = 0, right group = 6 â†’ f(0) Ã— f(6) = 5
If 1â€“4 shake: left group = 2, right group = 4 â†’ f(2) Ã— f(4) = 2
If 1â€“6 shake: left group = 4, right group = 2 â†’ f(4) Ã— f(2) = 2
If 1â€“8 shake: left group = 6, right group = 0 â†’ f(6) Ã— f(0) = 5

so, f(8)=f(0)f(6)+f(2)f(4)+f(4)f(2)+f(6)f(0) = 14
